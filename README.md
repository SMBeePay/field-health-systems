# Field Health Systems

A comprehensive SaaS platform that transforms artificial sports field testing data into actionable insights for athletic directors, facility managers, and maintenance teams.

## üèüÔ∏è Overview

Field Health Systems combines field testing IoT devices, data analytics, and predictive maintenance to ensure optimal field performance, athlete safety, and cost-effective maintenance scheduling.

### Key Features

- **Field Health Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring with status indicators (Excellent/Good/Monitor/Critical)
- **Testing Data Management**: Comprehensive interface for inputting field testing measurements
- **Smart Recommendations**: AI-powered maintenance recommendations based on sport-specific standards
- **Performance Analytics**: Interactive charts showing field performance trends over time
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated reports for FIFA, NCAA, NFHS, and custom standards

### Supported Sports

- Football (American)
- Soccer (FIFA Quality Pro compliant)
- Lacrosse
- Field Hockey
- Baseball
- Multi-Purpose Fields

## üß† Intelligence Engine

Our advanced knowledge base incorporates universal truths about artificial turf performance:

### GMAX (Shock Absorption)
- Range: 55-200 GMAX
- Sport-specific safety limits (Soccer <130, Football <200)
- Temperature impact modeling (can double on hot days >90¬∞F)
- Age degradation tracking (3% yearly increase)

### Shear Factor (Traction)
- Balanced resistance for optimal safety
- Sport-specific ranges to prevent slipping and knee injuries
- Moisture and temperature impact analysis

### Infill Depth
- Sport-specific optimal ranges (12-25mm)
- Migration and compaction modeling
- Weather impact on infill settling

## üöÄ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth interactions
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **Validation**: Zod for type-safe data validation
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Deployment**: Optimized for Vercel

## üìä Core Metrics

The system tracks three critical field performance metrics:

1. **GMAX**: Surface hardness measurement (lower is better)
2. **Shear Factor**: Rotational resistance for traction (balance is key)
3. **Infill Depth**: Exposed infill above fiber tips (sport-specific targets)

All metrics are evaluated against sport-specific standards with environmental condition adjustments.
